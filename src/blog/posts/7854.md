  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Learnability and \"Just In Time\"</strong></p>\n<p>By using an iconographic representation that exemplifies a functionality of their product, Bose allows its customers to learn how to use their headphones correctly. They accomplish this without complex, tedious and easy to lose manuals.</p>\n<p>Also, by physically stitching the label inside the case, Bose is capable of providing this valuable information to their customers right when they need it.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Bose is a well-known company when it comes to adding small details that enhance the experience of their products. Bose authentic headphones cases rely on a design principle known as \"Iconic/Iconographic Representation\" to teach their customers how the headphones should be folded to fit correctly within the carry case.</p>\n<p>When customers open the case, they will see that there's a small tag stitched inside the case. The tag has a printed example icon of the headphones in their ideal folded position. Bose uses this signage to help the customer understand the folding mechanism of the headphones without depending on written and potentially vague instructions. </p>\n<p>Also, since the tag is stitched inside the case, future owners/relatives can learn the folded position of the headphones as long as they have the original carry case.</p>"
