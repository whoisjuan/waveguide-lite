  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Learnability, Visibility and Recall Aid. </strong></p>\n<p>This simple behavior is a fantastic example of the value proposition and differentiation of Airtable.<br />Airtable understood that working with multiple spreadsheets is a tedious and cognitively expensive activity. This particular feature allows users to create mental models that can help them the identify specific documents faster.<br />The real-time update of the favicon serves as a reiteration of this concept and helps users to create a strong connection between the visual identifier and the content of a base. <br />It's also an excellent way to teach users that they can rely on the favicons to locate and differentiate bases across multiple tabs.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Airtable is a productivity web app that allows users to build complex databases with the ease and familiarity of a traditional spreadsheet. Users in Airtable can create bases which are smart spreadsheets that can be set to track workflows or processes. Each base has a name and users can assign them specific colors or iconography to facilitate their identification.</p>\n<p>This feature is particularly useful for large teams that are sharing and working on several bases simultaneously. <br />One particular behavior of this feature is that the resulting visual identifier (color + icon) is used as the favicon of the page when visualizing that specific base.</p>\n<p>When a user has several bases open across multiple tabs, favicons can be crucial to differentiate those bases. <br /></p>\n<p>Airtable adds extra detail to this feature by updating the favicon in real time when a user makes changes to the base identifier (color + icon). </p>\n<p><br /></p>"
