  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Increased Trust and Social Proof</strong></p>\n<p>This solution helps both the business and the prospect user. Activehours can increase their sign-ups by using transparency and social-proof as a conversion driver.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, users benefit from having real-time references on the app usage. </p>\n<p>This concept gives users a smoother transition through the conversion process and can help them to create a mental model of the app even before signing up. </p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Upon opening the Activehours app, new users are shown a sign-up screen with a live feed of nearby activity in the Activehours app.</p>\n<p>Activehours is an app that gives cash advances to hourly workers. Workers can sync their timesheets and advance money against those timesheets. One of the platform's main value propositions is the fact that there are no determined fees for these cash advances. Users pay what they think is fair.</p>\n<p>Given the nature of the business model, it's important to create mechanisms to increase the trust and transparency of the platform.</p>\n<p>Activehours shows real-time nearby activities associated like sign-ups, cash-outs and pays forward chains. By showing these events, Activehours prospects can have a real reference of how the app works and how its users interact with it.</p>\n<p>One concept that is worth noting is that this social activity feed is closely related to mechanisms like the ones found in apps like Instagram. This concept is an essential frame since it provides the users with a relatable and familiar layout.</p>\n<p>When using this solution is vital to protect user's privacy by not using real profile pictures or using name formats that can lead to their identification</p>"
