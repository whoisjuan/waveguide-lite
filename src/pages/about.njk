    <p class="mt-6 text-xl text-indigo-100 max-w-3xl">
      I'm a seasoned Product Designer / Product Hacker (but maybe my CV tells a better story)... I'm also the creator of Waveguide!<br><br> If this is the first time you visit Waveguide you may be surprised to learn that this website used be way larger and had a lot more resources than it does now.
      <br><br>
      <span class="text-2xl">This is the gist of what happened ðŸ‘‡</span>  
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>
        I created Waveguide as a design hub that had a lot of patterns, references and examples of design. It had +6000 registered users, +20k monthly views, +10k
        landing pages screenshots, hundreds of mobile screenshots and many other resources... <br>
        Every resource was augmented with color palettes, categorizations, reading insights and many other cool stuff that was automatically generated a pipeline of Machine Learning functions.
      <br><br>
      I feel like I created something useful with Waveguide, but it never felt like I would achieve the level of content quality that could have allow me to monetize the website.
      <br><br>
      So I shut it down because I lost motivation and honestly because it wasn't cheap to run and I'm a frugal person.
      <br>
      I only kept this static version that contains my favorite content.
      </span>
      <br><br>
      <span class="text-2xl">You may be wondering: Why is he telling me all this stuff? ðŸ¤”</span>
      <br><br>
      <span class="text-4xl font-semibold">Well, the reason is quite simple.<br> I want like-minded people to reach out to me!</span> 
      <br><br>Shutting down Waveguide wasn't easy because I love building things! But I saw this downscale as an opportunity to connect with interesting people by showing them how I think and what I can do.
      <br><br>
      <span class="text-xl font-semibold">So if you think you have something that I could help with, something that we should build together or something we should talk about, you should totally reach out!</span>
      <br><br>
      Here is a non-comprehensive list of things that I'm interested in and that I would be stoked to learn about:
