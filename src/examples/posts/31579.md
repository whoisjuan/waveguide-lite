  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Navigability and Learnability</strong></p>\n<p>In this example, we see two solutions that improve the experience of the passenger visiting this website.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, we have a classic coach-mark that teaches the user about functionality that is not evident in the first layer of interaction.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the functionality that the coach-mark is teaching (a dedicated button to open the map in a new tab), is by itself a great solution that improves the navigability of the website and allows users to quickly trigger an expected interaction for a page of this nature (launching in a new tab to keep at hand).</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Alaska Airlines as many other airlines in North America provides in-flight WiFi for the passenger. The WiFi is generally a paid service that requires a payment to enable free browsing. However, many airlines like Alaska provide extra functionality through their WiFi at no cost.</p>\n<p>These functionalities include In-Flight entertainment, airline information, gateway information, and flight tracker.</p>\n<p>When passengers connect to Alaska Airlines' in-flight WiFi and navigate to the flight tracker, they are greeted by a small coach-mark that teaches them about a dedicated button to launch the map in a new tab. Doing the latter, allows the passengers to keep navigating the in-flight website while having a single tab for their flight information.</p>"
