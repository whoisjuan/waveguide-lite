  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Just In Time, Reducing Friction, Delight</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes users have goals that go beyond the primary purpose of the platform they are using. In this case, Zeit facilitates an unusual behavior that is only specific to a tiny cohort of their users, but by providing this smooth path, they are increasing the chances that their brand will be used correctly while simultaneously creating a delightful moment for those users.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Zeit is a serverless architecture provider that allows developers to build serverless microservices and serverless applications rapidly.</p>\n<p>Zeit differentiates itself from other providers by having an opinionated approach when it comes to building developer tools and services, and their brand is a reflection of this approach.</p>\n<p>It’s not uncommon for developers who integrate a service like Zeit into other services and libraries, to showcase the logo of the integrated service in public repositories and marketing material.</p>\n<p>Usually, the best way to get the logo of another service is to download it from their website by inspecting the source code of the site and getting the URL of the image so it can be saved locally.</p>\n<p>Zeit gets ahead of this behavior by redirecting users who right-click their website’s navbar logo (which is an indication that they want to download the logo), to their branding page. There, the user can find all the guidelines on how to use Zeit’s logo, as well as finding different versions of the logo in multiple formats and resolutions.</p>"
