  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Improved Navigation and Speed</strong>.</p>\n<p>Users can emulate browser behaviors like comparing products by opening multiple browser tabs.</p>\n<p>This solution also gives speed users by helping them move back and forth between products without relying on the standard navigation flow of the app, which is optimized to favor the discoverability of products.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Amazon app users can tap and hold on images found on the different product listings to reveal a mini-thumbnail and a tray at the bottom of the app.</p>\n<p>The users can drag and drop that thumbnail into the tray which will display the last selected shopping list. The images that show up in the tray, point to the product listings of all the items contained in the shopping list.</p>\n<p>Users can quickly navigate between the products by tapping the images. They can also minimize the tray which will reveal a floating action button that brings back the list tray.</p>"
