  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Optimized Real Estate</strong></p>\n<p>There's no doubt that screen real estate is a common challenge for mobile application developers. This UI control is an excellent example of a user interface treatment that takes optimal advantage of the available screen real estate.</p>\n<p>Instead of using a regular segmented control under the navigation bar that takes vertical space and creates empty gutters, LIFX opted to add a segmented control as part of the nav-bar itself, and instead of being centered is aligned to the right. </p>\n<p>This alignment frees up space for other UI controls on the left side of the nav-bar.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>LIFX is a company that produces smart home lights. As with most companies in this space, LIFX has a dedicated app that allows its users to control the different light parameters like brightness, color, and on/off states.</p>\n<p>One major feature of these apps is the ability to create and control zones and groups, create scenes, and set up schedules, while maintaining the ability to create </p>\n<p>Due to the intricate information architecture behind these types of apps, there's a need to create UI controls that can show the different amount of named lists (groups, scenes, etc.), objects (lights), and modes (calendars, routines, etc.).</p>\n<p>A way to solve this problem is by breaking apart information is by using segmented controls. However, segmented controls can take a lot of screen real estate. </p>\n<p>This particular segmented control is unique because it's tucked to the right corner of the navigation bar and uses iconography instead of text.</p>"
