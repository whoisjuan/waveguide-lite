  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Optimized Real Estate.</strong></p>\n<p>Mobile views can be very challenging when it comes to optimizing information density within the available viewport.<br />Apps like Foursquare depend on showing the right information in a succinct and clear fashion. Sometimes doing this comes at the expense of creating a mobile-friendly design.</p>\n<p>In this case, Foursquare relies on an unbounded layout that shows the location map as a faded background image that blends with other relevant information like the Address and Hours. <br />This treatment allows Foursquare to display more information within a smaller container. </p>\n<p>In contrast, a similar layout with a bounding box for the map would likely create a view with less density and less information.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>The Foursquare app is a city guide app similar to Yelp, which allows users to browse business or places profiles, find their location, hours, location and other information.</p>\n<p>When users navigate into a place/business detail, they see a view that conveniently aggregates all the information pertinent to that place.</p>\n<p><br />Since showing and condensing such a significant amount of information into a narrow mobile view can be challenging, Foursquare opts to create a dedicated layout that fades the location map image behind other content like Address, Hours and Business Categories.</p>\n<p><br />This treatment allows the app to show more information without relying on a fixed box boundary.</p>"
