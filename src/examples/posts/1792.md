  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Optimized Real Estate and Discoverability.</strong><br /></p>\n<p>Apps that are heavy in text entry tasks like note-taking apps and document processors usually have to deal with the difficulties of limited mobile screen real estate.</p>\n<p>A critical part of text entry in mobile apps is the ability to move through text with speed. </p>\n<p>This task is particularly difficult to accomplish when viewing long documents since the virtual keyboard covers a significant amount of the screen. Usually, to achieve this, the user needs to leave the keyboard mode, scroll through the content and re-enter into the typing mode.<br />When leaving a text entry mode, most apps rely on 'out of focus' interactions like tapping a non-text entry area of the screen. This behavior is an incredibly unintuitive solution that can create confusing scenarios for the final user.</p>\n<p>Simplenote enhances the switch between modes by showing a dedicated button to collapse the keyboard. This button allows Simplenote to use the full-screen real estate for text entering and document rendering and helps the user to discover very quickly how to move between editing and view modes.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Simplenote is a minimalist note-taking app. The app has a design that heavily optimized writing and text entering. </p>\n<p>When a user creates or edits a new note the app automatically auto focuses into a writing state (cursor on, keyboard open), however unlike other text entry apps leaving the focus state is possible by tapping a button dedicated to collapse the keyboard.</p>\n<p>This mechanism allows the user to go back and forth between editing and preview text very fast, and without guessing implicit touch action to hide the keyboard.</p>"
