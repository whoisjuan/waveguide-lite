  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Discoverability, Visibility, Just in Time and Inferring Context</strong></p>\n<p>TRED's goal at the start of the customer's journey is to ensure a smooth, positive experience between potential buyers and sellers. Test driving a car is for many people a critical moment to decide whether to buy a vehicle or not. </p>\n<p>By creating mechanisms that increase the visibility of their features like scheduling a test drive, TRED is growing the possibility to enable positive interactions that can lead to a sale that is satisfactory to all the parties (TRED, buyer, and seller).</p>\n<p>In this particular case, contextually showing the \"Schedule Test Drive\" prompt in the body of the chat (in response to trigger words like \"test drive\") not only creates a more direct path to the desired functionality but it also teaches unknowing customers about a helpful feature.</p>\n<p>Fact: This solution got popular with the rise of chatbots. The goal of many of these chatbots is to extract context from the end-user and provide convenient options through a familiar interaction mechanic (typing text.) </p>\n<p>An increasing number of chatbots are designed to show \"just in time\" call to actions that allow the end-user to take particular decisions that are relevant to the context of the typed conversation. </p>\n<p>One notable example of this solution was the M virtual assistant by Facebook -<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_(virtual_assistant)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_(virtual_assistant)</a>-</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>TRED is a peer to peer online used car marketplace that enables secure buying and selling of vehicles. The platform takes over the pain points of buying/selling a car (like paperwork and car history check) and provides features for discovery and communication.</p>\n<p>One of those features is a secure, anonymous chat that allows buyers to make inquiries about listed cars. The platform also provides functionality that helps buyers and sellers to schedule test drives.</p>\n<p>These two features are closely related, especially since it's likely that most buyers will first check with the seller before scheduling a test drive.</p>\n<p>When the buyers mention \"test drive\" (and possibly other trigger words), the chat automatically prompts a call to action button in the body of the conversation that invites them to schedule a test drive.</p>"
