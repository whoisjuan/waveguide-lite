  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Keeping Context and Visibility.</strong></p>\n<p>Facebook uses this interaction to create a transition between states. </p>\n<p>This behavior allows users to have differentiated mental models for consuming and composing content which helps the user to remain in context and avoid situations like accidentally posting content.</p>\n<p>This interaction is also a smart alternative to similar techniques like modals that are known to have some visibility issues and therefore perform worse when trying to keep the user in context.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>In the Facebook Web App, the main news feed page has several interaction points. One key interaction point is the creation/sharing of content. To start composing a new post, Facebook users have to click on the text input box that lives above the rest of the news feeds.</p>\n<p><br />When a user clicks on the box with the intention of creating a new post, the whole user interface switches to a different visual mode in which the compose container becomes more visually prominent by being the only component in the page that remains unchanged.</p>\n<p>The rest of the user interface gets obscured by a translucent dark layer. This state change creates a visual effect in which the compose box is the only component grabbing the user's attention.</p>"
