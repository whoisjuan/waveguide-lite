  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Discoverability, Optimized Real Estate, and Ease of Use.</strong></p>\n<p>Horizontally scrollable views are far from ideal. However, there are some cases in which is difficult to render information rationally without exceeding the constraints of the viewport.</p>\n<p>In this case, Procore uses the small scrolling handle to allow users to discover that there's more content hidden behind the fixed container width. <br />The control itself is also helpful to interact with a table that otherwise wouldn't have a natural input mechanism for scrolling, especially if the user is using a PC mouse (a likely case in the construction industry). <br />This behavior is particularly important with an uncommon interactions like horizontal scrolling.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Procore is a construction software app that is used as a system of record for multiple Construction Documents like Submittals, Requests for Information and Observations. These documents are heavily structured and usually contain a considerable amount of fields that results in broad table representations.</p>\n<p>When rendering this data, the Procore web app uses fixed width tables that are horizontally scrollable. However horizontal scrolling is a non-optimal experience that can generate some problems with data parsing and interpretation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the issues that result from scrolling containers, Procore adds a small handle in the top-right corner of the table. Users can click, hold and drag the handle to control the horizontal scrolling on the table without relying on complicated scroll-bar interactions.</p>"
