  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Delight, Discoverability and Reducing Friction.</strong></p>\n<p>Apple products are known to have an incredible amount of detail and a broad range of surprising and delightful features in their products. </p>\n<p>In this case, Apple provides a significant interaction that is both delightful, and quickly discoverable.</p>\n<p>Since any small vibration or movement will light up the screen, the \"tap nudge\" functionality would be discovered almost by mistake. </p>\n<p>This decreases the amount of knowledge necessary by a user to learn about the Standnight mode and would likely increase the engagement with the watch by completely reducing the interactive barrier that is usually needed to manipulate a personal electronic device.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>The Apple Watch features a particular mode called Standnight mode. As described by Apple, the Standnight mode is a feature that works when the watch is charging, and it allows the user to see the date and time, along with the current charge and active alarms.</p>\n<p>To activate it, the user only needs to connect the watch, and it will go automatically into Nightstand mode.</p>\n<p>To light up the display and see all the available information, the user can press any of the buttons or touch the screen. However, the watch will also light up if the user taps (or even lightly rubs) on the surface in which the watch is laying down.</p>"
