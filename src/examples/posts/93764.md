  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Adapting Context</strong></p><p>According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center, 41% of car owners have listened to online radio via phone while in their car. (1)</p><p>Spotify acknowledges that a significant use case for their music streaming service happens inside the cars of their subscribers, and therefore adapting to this context can improve their experience with the app. </p><p>By creating a dedicated, self-enabled car mode, Spotify is helping its subscribers to operate the app safely when they are driving. </p><p>Although the ideal, is that drivers should never operate their mobile devices while driving, Spotify understands that customers will still try to manipulate their app somehow. Enabling a safer operation mode through context-awareness techniques is a way to help the final user avoid the risks of using an app that is not generally designed (or encouraged to be used) for car usage.</p><p>(1) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/07/State-of-the-News-Media_2017-Archive.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/07/State-of-the-News-Media_2017-Archive.pdf</a></p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>When a Spotify user launches the app and streams its audio to a car sound system, the app automatically changes the default view to a car specific view that is optimized for car usage.</p><p>The car view renders a larger UI with buttons that are 2x/3x the size of the standard view ones. The functionality available to the user is limited to skipping, rewinding, pausing/playing, liking, shuffling, and accessing the car mode context menu.</p><p>The car view also showcases a limited amount of information (Album/Playlist, Songname, Artist, and Playback Data). No Album-Art or Dynamic imagery is shown while the app is in this mode.</p><p>In our tests, the car view mode gets enabled every time that the phone connects to the Bluetooth connection that is identifiable to a car. We presume that Spotify is using a list of widely commercial car Bluetooth UUIDs or manufacturer specific data.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, we couldn't determine any other context detection functionality that enables the mode, but there may be more.</p>"
