  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Telltale and Delight</strong></p><p>Modern systems need to rely on different communication mechanics to show users the nature and behavior of the system.</p><p>In Twitter's system, there's is a particular need to communicate to the user that the system and its interactivity work in real-time. Without this communication precept, Twitter wouldn't exist.</p><p>Live counters of tweet interactions function as telltales that reinforce these concepts. Telltales are devices or objects that automatically give a visual indication of the state or presence of something.</p><p>In this context, live counters work as indicators that give the final user an idea of how the state of a tweet changes in popularity, which ultimately reinforces the concept of real-time communication.</p><p>Finally, small micro-interactions like these can help to increase the delightfulness factor of the service and therefore increase the overall satisfaction.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>Twitter became a social media powerhouse by creating a platform highly optimized for real-time interactions and content consumption. Twitter is usually the first-time source for many global events reporting, and it has become a critical public communications medium for politicians, companies, and high-visibility individuals.</p><p>Given that the real-time aspect of the network is one of its vital value propositions, Twitter has been investing heavily in creating interactions that allow people to get a pulse of how different topics and particular tweets evolves.</p><p>One of those features is the ability to see real-time interaction of individual tweets.</p><p>Twitter accomplished this by having live counters of likes, retweets, and replies.</p><p>As users scroll through the timeline or look at a particular tweet, they can notice how the counters change when new likes, retweets, and replies happen. These live counters are coupled with other interactions like real-time refreshing of the timeline and the comments list.</p>"
