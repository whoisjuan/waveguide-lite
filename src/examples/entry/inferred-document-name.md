  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Automation, Reducing Cognitive Load and Delight.</strong></p><p>By automatically inferring the title of a document, Google Docs automates a prevalent and repetitive document creation task, which ultimately helps the users in having a more lightweight and delightful experience.</p><p>Automating everyday tasks and intelligently inferring data on behalf of the users, are powerful strategies that can make interacting with a user interface more intuitive.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>When users create a new document inside Google Docs, the application takes them right inside the document and allows them to start typing and adding content immediately.</p><p>If the users never rename the document, this will be saved in the file system as an \"Untitled document.\"</p><p>When users want to rename a document that they are working on, they must click on the actual document title in the top left corner and type the title name they want for said document.</p><p>If there's content in the body of the document, Google Docs will automatically look for the first line and populate the title field with the first line. The auto-populated text is also pre-selected for speedy deletion in case the suggested title doesn't match the user's desired document title.</p><p>Since most documents start with some title, it's safe to assume the actual name of the file needs to correspond to the written body title. Google Docs relies on this assumption to help the user automate the process of naming a document. </p>"
