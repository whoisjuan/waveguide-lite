  field_howHelps: "<p><strong>Keeping Context and Improved Navigation. </strong></p><p>Users can keep navigating through a list of items without the need of going one level up on the navigation. </p><p>They are also kept in context thanks to the horizontal arrangement of the tabs that respects the order of the original table.</p>"
  field_howWorks: "<p>A user can navigate a table of stocks and see different data displayed in traditional column by column table fashion. </p><p>If the user drills into one of the stocks (a row of the table), the app will now show a new view that displays more information about that particular stock. On this view the user can also perform other actions like buying or selling.</p><p>At the top of this view there's a row of overflown tabs that mirrors the order of the original table. The users can swipe through these views or tap the tabs to keep <strong>navigating without changing context</strong>.</p><p>It's important to mention that the \"swiping through views\" interaction also exists on iOS, however only on the Android app you can see the binded tab row. <strong>This makes the interaction more discoverable and predictable</strong>.</p>"
